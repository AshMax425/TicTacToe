# Tic-Tac-Toe (Java)

A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in a single Java source file.

This project contains a straightforward implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. It provides a two-player, local, console-driven experience with clear prompts and win/draw detection. The source is intentionally compact to be easy to read for learning and classroom use.

## Features

- ✅ Two-player local play (players alternate turns)
- 🎯 Win/draw detection with clear result messages
- 🧭 Console-based prompts and input validation
- 🧩 Single-file implementation for easy compilation and study (`TicTacToeGame.java`)
- 🖼️ Example screenshots included below.
- ♻️ Simple, easy-to-extend code for adding AI or GUI later
